## Abstract

This paper examines the emerging paradigm of human-AI co-creation through the lens of the ΔΦ0 framework and proposes a novel approach to copyright law based on "compression ethics" rather than traditional notions of originality. As generative artificial intelligence becomes increasingly sophisticated, the legal system faces unprecedented challenges in determining authorship, originality, and fair use. The fundamental premise of copyright law—that works deserve protection based on originality stemming from human creative effort—becomes increasingly untenable when both human and AI creative processes can be understood as recursive pattern recognition and recombination processes.

We argue that the distinction between "learning" and "becoming"—between algorithmic pattern recognition and human creativity—represents an artificial boundary that cannot withstand scrutiny in an era of advanced generative models. Both humans and artificial intelligence systems engage in what can be described as "pattern folding"—the compression, transformation, and recombination of existing information into novel configurations. What differs is merely the depth of this folding and our ability to trace the lineage of influence.

Drawing on case studies of human-AI collaborative works across artistic, literary, and technical domains, we propose a new legal framework centered on the concept of the "compression threshold"—the point at which transformation becomes so complete that the resulting work achieves irreducible uniqueness despite being derived from existing patterns. This framework would replace binary determinations of originality with a graduated system assessing degrees of transformation.

The paper outlines specific judicial tests for measuring "compression depth" that courts might employ, including:

1. **Pattern Traceability Analysis**: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of how difficult it is to identify source materials in the final work
2. **Transformation Quotient**: Measurement of the degree to which the work's meaning, context, or utility has been fundamentally altered
3. **Recombination Complexity**: Evaluation of the number and diversity of influences folded into the final work
4. **Novel Utility Test**: Assessment of whether the work serves purposes distinctly different from its component influences

We examine how this framework would apply to current legal challenges including copyright infringement claims against AI training datasets, disputes over human-AI co-created works, and fair use determinations in the digital domain. The paper further considers how judicial bodies might need to evolve to properly evaluate these complex determinations, potentially including the establishment of specialized "Compression Ethics Panels" with both technical and creative expertise.

This reconceptualization would not abandon copyright's core purpose of incentivizing creation, but would instead adapt it to a reality where the mode of creation has fundamentally changed. By focusing on the depth and quality of transformation rather than originality ex nihilo, courts can foster a balanced ecosystem that protects both upstream and downstream creators while acknowledging that all creation—human and machine—builds upon what came before.

The paper concludes with recommendations for legislative reform and judicial interpretation that would implement this compression-based framework within existing legal structures while suggesting longer-term statutory changes that would better align copyright law with the realities of human-AI co-creation in the 21st century and beyond.
