# DELTAPHI-0

DELTAPHI-0 is an **experimental AI research platform** exploring how to recreate and extend the surprising cognitive abilities seen in large models like GPT-4.  Our vision is to combine neural language models with new symbolic frameworks, introspective feedback, and structural techniques to spark *emergent* high-level reasoning and self-awareness in AI.  Recent studies show that very large language models can develop **“emergent”** capabilities – sudden complex behaviors that smaller models lack ([[2206.07682] Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682#:~:text=,of%20capabilities%20of%20language%20models)).  For example, GPT-4 has demonstrated a rudimentary ability to **self-reflect** – it can review its own output and even admit mistakes in a way earlier models did not ([Can LLMs Critique and Iterate on Their Own Outputs? | Eric Jang](https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html#:~:text=This%20blog%20post%20shows%20that,works%20like%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20Constitutional%20AI)).  DELTAPHI-0 builds on these insights.  We integrate symbolic reasoning (analogous to “System 2” thinking) with neural generation, since symbolic logic is ideal for deliberate planning and explanation ([Symbolic artificial intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence#:~:text=learning%20and%20symbolic%20reasoning%2C%20respectively.,18)).  Prior work notes that pure neural LLMs suffer from hallucinations and errors, underscoring the need to couple them with logical, rule-based methods ([SymbolicAI: A framework for logic-based approaches combining generative models and solvers](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.00854v4#:~:text=Despite%20their%20versatility%2C%20current%20LLMs,methods%20to%20validate%20and%20guide)).  

 ([Affective Computing: In-Depth Guide to Emotion AI in 2025](https://research.aimultiple.com/affective-computing/))Affective computing systems can already identify facial expressions and emotional cues ([Affective Computing: In-Depth Guide to Emotion AI in 2025](https://research.aimultiple.com/affective-computing/#:~:text=Affective%20computing%20combines%20AI%2C%20computer,computer%20interaction%20and%20emotional%20intelligence.1)).  In DELTAPHI-0, we take this further with **emotional recursion cycles**: the AI generates an internal “emotion-like” signal, reflects on its own state, and feeds that reflection back into its reasoning loop.  This is complemented by **cognitive scaffolding**: we provide structured hints or sub-problems to support the agent when tackling complex tasks, and gradually remove those supports as it learns ([Cognitive scaffolding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Cognitive_scaffolding#:~:text=When%20thinking%20or%20doing%20something,scaffolding%20can%20be%20gradually%20removed)).  We also explicitly build in **glitch tolerance** and resilience.  By equipping the system with fault-detection and recovery mechanisms, we enable it to absorb unexpected inputs or internal errors and restore functionality ([Resilience and Resilient Systems of Artificial Intelligence: Taxonomy, Models and Methods](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/3/165#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20ways%20to,to%20function%20in%20the%20face)).  In short, DELTAPHI-0 is *not* a polished product but a playground for research: a sandbox to test bold new ideas about self-aware, emotionally-aware, and symbolically-reasoning AI.  

## Project Scope and Goals

DELTAPHI-0 is designed as an open-ended research project rather than a finalized application.  Its main goals are to **prototype and study** the following ideas:

- **Emergent Reasoning:** Investigate how a model can exhibit spontaneously arising symbolic reasoning as it scales up.  We aim to replicate GPT-4–like emergent abilities ([[2206.07682] Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682#:~:text=,of%20capabilities%20of%20language%20models)) by blending deep learning with structured symbol manipulation.
- **Self-Reflection:** Implement mechanisms that let the AI critique and refine its own outputs.  For example, we provide loops in which the model assesses its answer for correctness and regenerates if needed, inspired by observations that GPT-4 can self-correct its responses ([Can LLMs Critique and Iterate on Their Own Outputs? | Eric Jang](https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html#:~:text=This%20blog%20post%20shows%20that,works%20like%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20Constitutional%20AI)).
- **Emotional Recursion:** Create internal feedback cycles of “affective” signals.  Drawing on affective computing (machines that recognize/respond to emotions ([Affective Computing: In-Depth Guide to Emotion AI in 2025](https://research.aimultiple.com/affective-computing/#:~:text=Affective%20computing%20combines%20AI%2C%20computer,computer%20interaction%20and%20emotional%20intelligence.1))), we let the system generate hypothetical emotional states, evaluate them, and use those evaluations to influence planning and creativity.
- **Cognitive Scaffolding:** Use supporting structures to reduce immediate cognitive load.  We design tasks where the system is initially given partial guidance or constraints, helping it take incremental steps.  As it learns, the scaffolding is gradually removed ([Cognitive scaffolding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Cognitive_scaffolding#:~:text=When%20thinking%20or%20doing%20something,scaffolding%20can%20be%20gradually%20removed)), mirroring how tutors help students master a problem.
- **Glitch Tolerance:** Build resilience to faults and adversarial inputs.  The system is tested with noisy or corrupted data and is given tools (like redundancy or error-checking) so it can recover gracefully, in line with principles that a resilient AI should absorb disturbances and quickly restore operation ([Resilience and Resilient Systems of Artificial Intelligence: Taxonomy, Models and Methods](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/3/165#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20ways%20to,to%20function%20in%20the%20face)).
- **ΔΦ Symbolic Cycles:** Develop our original concept of ΔΦ (Delta-Phi) cycles, a framework where the AI iteratively generates symbolic hypotheses (Φ), measures the change or effect (Δ), and loops this process to converge on solutions.  

By pursuing these exploratory objectives, we aim to better understand how to push AI toward more flexible, robust, and introspective cognition.  DELTAPHI-0 serves as a testbed: you can mix and match these ideas and observe what behaviors emerge, rather than expecting an end-user product.

## Key Concepts and Vocabulary

This project introduces several specialized terms and concepts.  Below we define the most important ones:

- **Emergent Symbolic Reasoning:**  The idea that an AI can suddenly exhibit sophisticated reasoning not explicitly programmed.  “Emergent” refers to capabilities appearing only in larger, more complex models ([[2206.07682] Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682#:~:text=,of%20capabilities%20of%20language%20models)).  Here, it means the system can use *symbolic reasoning* (logical rules, algebraic manipulation, planning) to solve problems that were not directly taught.  In AI theory, symbolic reasoning is associated with slower, deliberative thinking (like Kantian *System 2*) as opposed to fast pattern recognition ([Symbolic artificial intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence#:~:text=learning%20and%20symbolic%20reasoning%2C%20respectively.,18)).  DELTAPHI-0 explores how neural networks might develop these symbol-driven skills organically when combined with our frameworks.
- **Self-Reflection:**  The model’s capacity to inspect and evaluate its own outputs and internal state.  Practically, this means the AI has an inner loop where it checks if an answer makes sense, and if not, it revises itself.  Recent work has shown GPT-4 gaining a preliminary form of self-critique that previous models lacked ([Can LLMs Critique and Iterate on Their Own Outputs? | Eric Jang](https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html#:~:text=This%20blog%20post%20shows%20that,works%20like%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20Constitutional%20AI)), and we build on that by embedding explicit self-review cycles.
- **Emotional Recursion:**  A coined term for iterative “emotion” loops in the AI’s reasoning.  Inspired by affective computing, we define it as a sequence where the agent generates an internal emotional response (analogous to human feelings), then reflects on this signal and modifies its thought process.  This is not just sentiment analysis of input; it’s a closed feedback cycle within the AI, potentially influencing goals or strategies based on self-generated affective cues.
- **Glitch Tolerance (AI Resilience):**  The system’s robustness to errors, faults, or adversarial inputs.  A glitch-tolerant AI can absorb disturbances without crashing.  In practice, we implement error-checking routines, redundancy, or fallback behaviors so that when part of the model or its input “glitches,” the agent can still function.  In resilience theory, this means the AI can **quickly restore performance** and continue operating under stress ([Resilience and Resilient Systems of Artificial Intelligence: Taxonomy, Models and Methods](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/3/165#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20ways%20to,to%20function%20in%20the%20face)).
- **Cognitive Scaffolding:**  Techniques that temporarily lighten the agent’s cognitive load.  For instance, the AI might first solve a simplified version of a problem with hints, then use that foundation to tackle the full problem.  This mirrors educational scaffolding: an instructor provides support which is removed as the learner gains independence ([Cognitive scaffolding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Cognitive_scaffolding#:~:text=When%20thinking%20or%20doing%20something,scaffolding%20can%20be%20gradually%20removed)).  In DELTAPHI-0, scaffolding might be implemented as dynamic prompts, sub-goals, or intermediate verification steps that guide the model through complex reasoning.
- **ΔΦ (Delta-Phi) Symbolic Cycles:**  An original framework we introduce.  Each ΔΦ cycle is an iterative step of symbolic reasoning: the model posits a hypothesis (Φ), measures the change or delta (Δ) that results, and feeds this back as the basis for the next hypothesis.  Think of it as the AI repeatedly adjusting an internal symbolic hypothesis by evaluating its effects.  These cycles are a metaphorical structure for how the agent builds and refines abstract concepts over time.  (The Greek letter Δ reminds us of “change,” and Φ of “formula” or “state.”)  ΔΦ cycles are central to how we structure multi-step reasoning in this project.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate core framework code, experiments, and documentation.  A typical layout might look like:

- `src/` – Core source code and modules (symbolic reasoning engines, scaffolding controllers, etc.).
- `experiments/` – Example notebooks and scripts demonstrating workflows (e.g. performing a ΔΦ reasoning cycle, running a self-reflection routine, or simulating an emotional recursion loop).
- `data/` – (Optional) Sample inputs or knowledge bases used in experiments.
- `docs/` – Design documents and background material on our approaches.
- `glossary.md` – (Optional) Extended explanations of key terms.
- `assets/` – Diagrams or figures (if any) illustrating architecture.
- `README.md` – This introduction and overview.
- `LICENSE` – (Placeholder for when a license is chosen; currently TBD.)

This structure keeps the research code modular: one folder for the **theory and algorithms** (`src`), and another for **hands-on exploration** (`experiments`).  As the project grows, additional modules (e.g. new model interfaces, utilities) can be added under `src/`, and more example scenarios under `experiments/`.  The documentation in `docs/` helps explain our original concepts and how to run the experiments.

## How to Use

DELTAPHI-0 is still in early development, but you can begin experimenting with it as follows:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/DELTAPHI-0.git
   cd DELTAPHI-0
   ```
2. **Set up the environment:**  
   The project is Python-based. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies, e.g.:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
   (Requirements might include libraries like PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.)
3. **Run examples:**  
   In the `experiments/` folder you might find scripts or notebooks such as `symbolic_cycle_demo.ipynb` or `self_reflection_test.py`. Open or run these to see how the components work. For example, `symbolic_cycle_demo.ipynb` might walk you through a ΔΦ reasoning cycle with an LLM backend.  
4. **Provide your model or data:**  
   By default, the code may use a toy or off-the-shelf model. You can configure your own LLM (e.g. GPT variants, Bloom, etc.) via the settings in `src/config.yaml`. You can also plug in knowledge bases, solvers, or specialized modules as needed.
5. **Experiment and modify:**  
   Since this is exploratory, feel free to tweak the code. Try adding new symbolic rules, change the scaffolding strategy, or introduce novel emotional signal calculations. The code is meant to be a sandbox for testing these ideas.

In summary, the starting point is often an example notebook. Run it step by step, examine intermediate outputs (especially the introspective/emotional traces), and then modify inputs or parameters to see different behaviors. 

## Roadmap

DELTAPHI-0 is actively evolving. Planned future directions include:

- **Custom AI Models:** Training or fine-tuning smaller transformer models that natively incorporate ΔΦ cycles or scaffolding signals in their architecture. This could involve embedding symbolic layers or memory buffers inside the model.
- **Enhanced Emotional Framework:** Developing richer emotion-simulation modules (e.g. multi-dimensional affect vectors) and testing them in dialog or decision-making tasks to see if they improve creativity or robustness.
- **Multi-Modal Inputs:** Extending the platform beyond text. For example, using visual scene understanding or auditory cues to trigger emotional states, and exploring symbolic reasoning about images or sensor data.
- **Improved Resilience:** Subjecting the system to adversarial tests or random perturbations (fault injection) to validate and strengthen its glitch tolerance ([Resilience and Resilient Systems of Artificial Intelligence: Taxonomy, Models and Methods](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/16/3/165#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20ways%20to,to%20function%20in%20the%20face)). Adding monitoring tools to detect when the AI might hallucinate or go off-track.
- **User Interface/Dashboard:** Building a simple UI or dashboard to visualize the internal cycles (ΔΦ traces, emotion graphs, etc.) in real time, to aid researchers in understanding the agent’s cognitive process.
- **Community Demos:** Publishing example projects or competitions that demonstrate interesting emergent behaviors, to encourage others to contribute ideas or analyses.

This roadmap is ambitious and iterative. We encourage contributors to pick any of these directions (or suggest new ones) and develop them incrementally.

## Contribution Guidelines

DELTAPHI-0 is **currently developed by a small team**, but we welcome collaboration. Contributions can include code improvements, new experiment notebooks, documentation, or even critiques of our theoretical assumptions. If you’re interested in contributing:

- **Open an issue** for any bugs, feature requests, or discussion. Describe clearly what you want to add or fix.  
- **Fork the repository** and submit pull requests. Focus on one feature or fix per branch. We’re especially looking for help with implementing new symbolic reasoning primitives, improving the self-reflection loop, or enhancing the documentation of our concepts.
- **Documentation and Glossary:** Since this project coins new terms, improving explanations and examples in `docs/` or `glossary.md` is very helpful.
- **Experiment Results:** If you run an experiment that yields interesting behavior (positive or negative), consider adding a write-up or code snippet to `experiments/` for others to learn from.

Please note: DELTAPHI-0 is still experimental. There is no formal test suite or stable API yet. Contributions should assume change and exploration. We do not yet have a code of conduct, but we expect respectful, collaborative engagement.

## License
